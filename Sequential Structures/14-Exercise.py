"""John Fisherman, a good man, bought a PC to control his workÂ´s daily income.
Every time he brings more fish than that established by the fishing regulations(50 kilograms),
he must pay a fine of $ 4.00 per excess kilogram.
John needs you to write a program that reads the fish weight and calculates the excess.
Record the kilograms beyond the limit and calculate the fine that John will have to pay.
Print the program data with the appropriate messages."""
